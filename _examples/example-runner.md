#
# `slug`.md
#     The filename is called the `slug` and will be used in URLs and referencing
#     other runs. This should not change in the future, as it will take some
#     effort to change all existing references.
#
# `title`
#     Enter a (nick) name.
#
# `twitter` , `youtube`, `twitch`, `patreon`
#     Enter full URLs (with https://), or leave empty if you don't have it.
#
# `country`
#     A two-letter country code for the country you wanna represent.
#     It's a fun thing. Leave empty if you do not want a flag next to your name.
#
# `weapons`
#     Remove all the weapons that you do not _master_.
#     Runners will be shown on the weapon pages, and on the Runners page under the
#     "Weapon Masters" section. If empty, set `weapons: []` instead.
