#
# `slug`.md
#     The filename is called the `slug`. Try to give it an easy and recognizable
#     name. So it's easily updated if you have a new record.
#
# `title`
#     Optional. Enter a cool name for you run.
#
# `video`
#     Enter an embed link. For youtube, try to keep that format without all the
#     query string parameters.
#
# `run_type`
#     Controversial for sure. Currently, here is `freestyle` and `ta-wiki-rules`
#     It's mostly for tracking runs and will maybe a thing in the future.
#     Note: `ta-wiki-rules` prohibits PC users from submitting new runs. So we
#           need something new. Plus, `ta-wiki-rules` runs neeed to be validated.
#     Note: Also mods.
#
# `platform`
#     ...
#
# `patch_version`
#     ...
#
# `date`
#     Use the following format `yyyy-mm-dd`.
#
# `time`
#     Always use the full format, like `00'00"00`.
#
# `quest`
#     Select the quest it belongs to, see the `quests` folder and check for the
#     filename, or check the quest on the website, and check the URL.
#
# `runners`
#     List of runners. Use the "slugs", i.e. filenames, of the runners.
#
# `weapons`
#     List of all weapons used in this run.
