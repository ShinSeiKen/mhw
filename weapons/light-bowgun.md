The light bowgun allows for greater mobility and evasive capabilities, and relatively fast shooting. Though it can provide outstanding support with the use of ammo with abnormal status properties, its drawbacks include heavy recoil and small ammo capacities.

You can change a bowgun's properties with custom mods at the Smithy.
