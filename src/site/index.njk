        <h2>Welcome Hunter!</h2>
        <p>
            This is the place to check out speedruns for <em>Monster Hunter World</em>, an action role-playing game developed and published by Capcom.
        </p>
        <h2>Update</h2>
        <p>
            You can now submit runners and runs (only Arch-Tempered and <a href="/quests/custom-quest/9★-delbuster-cup/">9★ Delbuster Cup</a> for now):
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/submit-runner">Submit runner</a></li>
            <li><a href="/submit-run">Submit run</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Roadmap</h2>
        <p>
            The community's response has been great. In the coming weeks, I want to add more runners and runs. Then see if I can establish some sort of leaderboards (e.g. for Arch Tempered monsters).
            Added some filters and tables, but they're experimental and they still need a lot of work for smaller screen sizes.
