Welcome to the Monster Hunter World Leaderboards site!

The idea originated in several Discords.
There was no (English) site that tracked a variety of speedruns that:

- Allowed a ruleset more lenient than TA wiki rules (e.g. _freestyle_);
- Allowed PC runs in general;
- Allowed certain mods (e.g. cosmetic or elimination of _pre_-quest RNG).

This site is meant to keep us busy and motivated.
At least, until the release of Monster Hunter World Iceborne.

Other sites that currently track runs are:

- [モンスターハンターワールド攻略](http://mhw.wiki-db.com/) known as the TA wiki; and
- [Speedrun.com MHW](https://www.speedrun.com/mhw) ([PC](https://www.speedrun.com/mhwpc)).


Personally, this was a great moment to learn new web development stuff.
This is still an early prototype, so expect some flaws and fine-tuning.
In the meantime, enjoy your stay!
