title: Caverns of El Dorado

The Caverns of El Dorado are a peculiar network of caverns shaped and influenced both by the Everstream and the minerals that Kulve Taroth has collected over the years. Kulve Taroth's nesting ground—as yet undiscovered—is rumored to rest within the deepest region of the caverns, from which tremendous geothermal energies seem to emanate.
